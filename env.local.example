# Email Configuration for Contact Form

# For Gmail, you'll need to:
# 1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Google account
# 2. Generate an App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
# 3. Use that App Password as SMTP_PASSWORD (not your regular Gmail password)

SMTP_EMAIL=Vidvatta.academy@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password_here

# Note: Never commit .env.local to version control!
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual values
